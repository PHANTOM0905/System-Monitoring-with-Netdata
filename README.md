# 🚀 DevOps Internship - Task 7: Real-Time System Monitoring with Netdata

**Infrastructure Visibility for Performance Optimization**

## 📋 Task Objective

Deploy **Netdata** as a real-time monitoring solution to:

- Detect anomalies in system resources (CPU throttling, memory leaks, disk saturation)
- Monitor containerized workloads (Docker resource utilization)
- Implement alerting for threshold breaches
- Establish visibility into infrastructure performance golden signals:
  - Latency
  - Traffic
  - Errors
  - Saturation
  - Success Metrics

### ✅ Achievements

- ✅ Netdata running in Docker container  
- ✅ Dashboard capturing critical system KPIs  
- ✅ Verified alerting mechanism  
- ✅ Documented operational insights

## 🔍 Why Monitoring is Foundational in DevOps

### 📦 The Feedback Loop

| Purpose | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Prevent Outages** | Catch disk-full scenarios before they crash apps |
| **Cost Optimization** | Identify overprovisioned resources (e.g., idle VMs) |
| **Performance Baselines** | Establish normal behavior to detect anomalies |
| **Blameless Debugging** | Metric history accelerates root-cause analysis |

### 🧪 Real-World Impact

| Failure Mode         | How Netdata Helps                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Memory Leak          | RAM usage trend alerts before OOM killer |
| CPU Throttling       | Detect sustained >80% usage              |
| Disk IOPS Saturation | Identify slow I/O during peak loads      |
| Container Sprawl     | Track resource-hungry orphaned containers|

## 🛠 Implementation Guide

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Docker installed (Linux, macOS, or Windows)

### 🐳 Step 1: Launch Netdata Container

```bash
docker run -d --name=netdata -p 19999:19999 netdata/netdata

### 🌐 Step 2: Access Dashboard
- Local machine: http://localhost:19999

- Remote server: http://<SERVER_IP>:19999

📊 Step 3: Monitor Critical DevOps Metrics
Section	Key Metrics	DevOps Use Case
System	CPU wait time, RAM pressure	Identify resource bottlenecks
Docker	CPU throttling, OOM kills	Debug misbehaving containers
Network	TCP retransmits, bandwidth	Diagnose connectivity issues
Alerts	Custom threshold breaches	Proactive incident prevention

❓ Interview Questions (Task 7)
1. What does Netdata monitor?
System Resources: CPU, RAM, disk I/O, network interfaces

Containerized Workloads: Docker/containerd metrics

Applications: Nginx, MySQL, Apache (via 300+ plugins)

Custom Metrics: With Python or Node.js scripts

2. How do you view real-time metrics?
Access: http://localhost:19999

Auto-refreshes every 1 second, no extra config

3. How is Netdata different from Prometheus?
Feature	Netdata	Prometheus
Metric Granularity	Real-time (1s)	Time series (pull-based)
Auto-Discovery	Yes	No (manual config required)
All-in-One	Yes	No (needs Grafana, etc.)
Anomaly Detection	Built-in	Basic alerting only

4. What is a Collector?
Collectors are lightweight plugins that gather metrics:

proc.plugin: Linux kernel stats

cgroups.plugin: Docker resource usage

mysql.plugin: App metrics

Custom collectors in /etc/netdata/python.d/

5. What are some performance KPIs to watch?
KPI	Threshold	DevOps Impact
CPU Steal Time	>10%	Indicates VM oversubscription
RAM Page Faults	>100/sec	Triggers OOM crashes
Disk Await Time	>20ms	Storage bottlenecks
Container Restarts	>5/hour	App crash-loop warning

6. How to deploy Netdata on a VM?
bash
Copy
Edit
# Install Docker (if not already)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Run Netdata container
docker run -d \
  --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  netdata/netdata
7. How does Netdata alerting work?
Rules in /etc/netdata/health.d/ (e.g., ram usage > 90%)

Notification Channels: Slack, Email, PagerDuty

False Positive Reduction: Uses rolling averages

8. What is a Dashboard in this context?
A web-based interface for:

Visualizing system metrics live

Browsing historical performance

Detecting anomalies visually

🎯 Conclusions
✅ Infrastructure Observability Achieved
Real-time metrics with 1s granularity

Threshold-based alerts for CPU, RAM, disk

🐳 Container-Native Visibility
Docker runtime metrics monitored

Verified resource isolation between containers

🚨 Incident Prevention Framework
Alerting for early warnings

Dashboards for outage troubleshooting
